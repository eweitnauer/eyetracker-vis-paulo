Eyetracker - Visualization
==========================

This is a visualization of Paulo's data from an eyetracking experiment using d3.js. It will show
stacked bars where the color of each segment codes the target the subject looked at. The code has
some parts that are quite specific to the data format, but it should not be too hard to adapt it to
other data.
